# Arbitrary-Length-Integers
Many applications, such as cryptography, require very large integers (much larger than would fit into 32- or 64-bit integer types). The standard library of many languages includes a “Big Integer” or ”Long Integer” data type which can store arbitrarily large integers.  Here, implement an array-based Long Integer Data Structure (“LongInt”), where there is no predefined limit on the maximum value that can be stored. Such a LongInt can have an arbitrary number of digits (e.g., tens of thousands of digits, or millions of digits). Additionally implement operations for adding, subtracting, and comparing long integers.
